    <h3>The works of Ta-Nehisi Coates</h3>
        <p>While Ta-Nehisi Coates is well known for books and articles on social justic issues, such as "Between the World and Me"<span class = "footer">1</span>,
        few people are aware that he was actually the writer for the most recent reboot of the "Black Panther" comic book series<span class = "footer">2</span>.
        While comics are a major departure from his normal literary contributions<span class = "footer">3</span>, Black Panther as a comic series 
        focuses on issues of race and power in ways that are somewhat atypical for other comics<span class = "footer">4</span>, making Coates' involvement
        more characteristic.

        <script>
//Create a click event using jQuery for the button with the id minimize to shrink the size of each footer to 7px, and each footnote to 10px.

// When the button is clicked, the font for both classes should change.

// You can use either .click or .on to solve this problem.
